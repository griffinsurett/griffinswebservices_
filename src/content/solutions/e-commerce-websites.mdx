    <p>
      Together we audit SKUs, options, fulfillment steps, and customer service flows to
      build a storefront that handles real-life complexity. Product templates and bundles
      remain easy for your team to maintain without breaking downstream systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Performance-tuned storefronts pair with marketing automations, abandoned cart flows,
      and loyalty campaigns so every visit is nurtured across channels. We also set up
      analytics, data layers, and dashboards to track what messaging or promotions
      actually drive contribution margin.
