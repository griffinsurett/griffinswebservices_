    <p>
      Every landing page begins with a conversion workshop that captures the offer, proof,
      objections, and follow-up path. We turn that strategy into modular content blocks
      that can be rearranged for experiments while keeping the story tight and on-brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We handle responsive builds, CRM connections, and analytics wiring so ads managers
      can see what audiences, CTAs, and form fields are producing pipeline. Post-launch,
      we can ship alternate hero concepts or thank-you experiences without restarting the
      entire sprint.
