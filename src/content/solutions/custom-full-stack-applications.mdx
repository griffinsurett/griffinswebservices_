    <p>
      Discovery sessions translate your business logic into user stories, data models, and
      integrations. We design interfaces alongside API contracts so front-end and back-end
      work can move in parallel, then establish staging and delivery pipelines with
      automated testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security, role-based permissions, auditing, and performance budgets are treated as
      core features—not afterthoughts. As we near launch, we provide training, release
      plans, and observability dashboards so internal teams can steward the product.
