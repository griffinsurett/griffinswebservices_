    <p>
      From content audits to category strategy, we map how your subject-matter expertise
      should be packaged and routed through the CMS. Custom author profiles, topic hubs,
      and resource blocks keep readers exploring and make internal linking effortless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technical SEO is baked in: schema, XML feeds, fast image handling, and accessibility
      testing. We also plan migration scripts or content imports so legacy articles keep
      their rankings while benefiting from the updated design system.
