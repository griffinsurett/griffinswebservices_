    <p>
      You didn't start your business to become a web designer. You have customers to serve, a team to lead, a company to grow. But here's the truth: your website is often the first impression potential customers get of your business.
    </p>
    <p>
      We build websites that make that first impression count. Custom designs that reflect your brand, lightning-fast load times that keep visitors engaged, and SEO-friendly architecture so people can actually find you on Google.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the scenes, you get a site you can actually manage yourself. Update text, swap images, and add pages without calling us. And when you need help, we're here—hosting, maintenance, and support included.
